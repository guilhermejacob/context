# Poverty Indices {#poverty}

Poverty has been a topic of conversation throughout human history. As @ravallion2016 points out, Aristotle and Confucius discussed ideas about poverty. In fact, Aristotle's ideas influenced Thomas Aquinas, one of the pillars of Western philosophy. Since then, societies changed, modifying the theories of justice underlying the idea of poverty.

As the concept and the ethics towards poverty change, so does its measurement. From basic measures like the headcount rate to more complex metrics, such as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, poverty measurement has evolved. Nowadays, poverty estimates are calculated using household surveys and censuses [@deaton1997]. However, only recently have the aspects of statistical inference combining such measures and complex sample survey designs been explored (for more discussion on this topic, see @deville1999, @berger2003, @bhat2007, and @osier2009).  These advances became even more important given the recent efforts in poverty mapping, an analytical method that combines poverty analysis and small area estimation, like @elbers2003 and @bedi2007.

This chapter shows how poverty estimates and their sampling errors can be estimated using simple commands from the `convey` package.

## At Risk of Poverty Threshold (svyarpt)

The at-risk-of-poverty threshold (ARPT) is a measure used to define the people whose incomes imply a low standard of living in comparison to the general living standards.  Even though some people are not below the effective poverty line, those below the ARPT can be considered "almost deprived".

This measure is defined as $0.6$ times the median income for the entire population:

$$
arpt = 0.6 \times median(y),
$$
where $y$ is the income variable and `median` is estimated for the whole population. The details of the linearization of the ARPT are discussed by @deville1999 and @osier2009.

**A replication example**

The R `vardpoor` package [@vardpoor], created by researchers at the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, includes an ARPT coefficient calculation using the ultimate cluster method.  The example below reproduces those statistics.

Load and prepare the same data set:

```{r}
# load the convey package
library(convey)

# load the survey library
library(survey)

# load the vardpoor library
library(vardpoor)

# load the laeken library
library(laeken)

# load the synthetic EU statistics on income & living conditions
data(eusilc)

# make all column names lowercase
names(eusilc) <- tolower(names(eusilc))

# add a column with the row number
dati <- data.table::data.table(IDd = 1:nrow(eusilc), eusilc)

# calculate the arpt coefficient
# using the R vardpoor library
varpoord_arpt_calculation <-
  varpoord(
    # analysis variable
    Y = "eqincome",
    
    # weights variable
    w_final = "rb050",
    
    # row number variable
    ID_level1 = "IDd",
    
    # row number variable
    ID_level2 = "IDd",
    
    # strata variable
    H = "db040",
    
    N_h = NULL ,
    
    # clustering variable
    PSU = "rb030",
    
    # data.table
    dataset = dati,
    
    # arpt coefficient function
    type = "linarpt",
    
    # get linearized variable
    outp_lin = TRUE
  )


# construct a survey.design
# using our recommended setup
des_eusilc <-
  svydesign(
    ids = ~ rb030 ,
    strata = ~ db040 ,
    weights = ~ rb050 ,
    data = eusilc
  )

# immediately run the convey_prep function on it
des_eusilc <- convey_prep(des_eusilc)

# coefficients do match
varpoord_arpt_calculation$all_result$value
coef(svyarpt( ~ eqincome , des_eusilc))

# linearized variables do match
# vardpoor
lin_arpt_varpoord <- varpoord_arpt_calculation$lin_out$lin_arpt
# convey
lin_arpt_convey <- attr(svyarpt( ~ eqincome , des_eusilc), "lin")

# check equality
all.equal(lin_arpt_varpoord, lin_arpt_convey)

# variances do not match exactly
attr(svyarpt( ~ eqincome , des_eusilc) , 'var')
varpoord_arpt_calculation$all_result$var

# standard errors do not match exactly
varpoord_arpt_calculation$all_result$se
SE(svyarpt( ~ eqincome , des_eusilc))
```

The variance estimate is computed by using the approximation defined in \@ref(var), while the linearized variable $z$ is defined by \@ref(lin). The functions `convey::svyarpt` and `vardpoor::linarpt` produce the same linearized variable $z$.

However, the measures of uncertainty do not line up, because `library(vardpoor)` defaults to an ultimate cluster method that can be replicated with an alternative setup of the `survey.design` object.

```{r}
# within each strata, sum up the weights
cluster_sums <-
  aggregate(eusilc$rb050 , list(eusilc$db040) , sum)

# name the within-strata sums of weights the `cluster_sum`
names(cluster_sums) <- c("db040" , "cluster_sum")

# merge this column back onto the data.frame
eusilc <- merge(eusilc , cluster_sums)

# construct a survey.design
# with the fpc using the cluster sum
des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster <-
  svydesign(
    ids = ~ rb030 ,
    strata = ~ db040 ,
    weights = ~ rb050 ,
    data = eusilc ,
    fpc = ~ cluster_sum
  )

# again, immediately run the convey_prep function on the `survey.design`
des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster <-
  convey_prep(des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster)

# matches
attr(svyarpt(~ eqincome , des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster) , 'var')
varpoord_arpt_calculation$all_result$var

# matches
varpoord_arpt_calculation$all_result$se
SE(svyarpt(~ eqincome , des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster))
```

For additional usage examples of `svyarpt`, type `?convey::svyarpt` in the R console.

## At Risk of Poverty Ratio (svyarpr)

The at-risk-of-poverty rate (ARPR) is the share of persons with an income below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold (ARPT). The logic behind this measure is that although most people below the ARPT cannot be considered "poor", they are the ones most vulnerable to becoming poor in the event of a negative economic phenomenon like a recession.

The ARPR is a composite estimate, taking into account both the sampling error in the proportion itself and that in the ARPT estimate. The details of the linearization of the ARPR are discussed by @deville1999 and @osier2009.

The variance estimate is computed by using the approximation defined in \@ref(var), while the linearized variable $z$ is defined by \@ref(lin). The functions `convey::svyarpr` and `vardpoor::linarpr` produce the same linearized variable $z$.

However, the measures of uncertainty do not line up. One of the reasons is that `library(vardpoor)` defaults to an ultimate cluster method that can be replicated with an alternative setup of the `survey.design` object.

```{r}
# within each strata, sum up the weights
cluster_sums <-
  aggregate(eusilc$rb050 , list(eusilc$db040) , sum)

# name the within-strata sums of weights the `cluster_sum`
names(cluster_sums) <- c("db040" , "cluster_sum")

# merge this column back onto the data.frame
eusilc <- merge(eusilc , cluster_sums)

# construct a survey.design
# with the fpc using the cluster sum
des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster <-
  svydesign(
    ids = ~ rb030 ,
    strata = ~ db040 ,
    weights = ~ rb050 ,
    data = eusilc ,
    fpc = ~ cluster_sum
  )

# again, immediately run the convey_prep function on the `survey.design`
des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster <-
  convey_prep(des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster)

# does not match
attr(svyarpr(~ eqincome , des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster) , 'var') * 10000
varpoord_arpr_calculation$all_result$var

# does not match
varpoord_arpr_calculation$all_result$se
SE(svyarpr(~ eqincome , des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster)) * 100
```

Still, there is a difference in the estimates. This is discussed in detail in [this issue](https://github.com/ajdamico/convey/issues/372). 
In order to still provide additional examples for our code, we proceed with a Monte Carlo experiment. 

Using the `eusilcP` data from the `simPop` package [@R-simPop], we can compute the actual value of the at risk of poverty rate for that population:

```{r}
# load libraries
library( sampling )
library( survey )
library( convey )

# load pseudo population data
data( "eusilcP" , package = "simPop" )

# compute population median
q50.pop <- convey:::computeQuantiles( eusilcP$eqIncome , rep( 1 , length( eusilcP$eqIncome ) ) , .50 )

# compute population poverty threshold
# as 60% of the median
thresh.pop <- .60 * q50.pop

# compute population at risk of poverty rate
( theta.pop <- mean( eusilcP$eqIncome <= thresh.pop , na.rm = TRUE ) )

```

Now, to study the distribution of the estimator under a particular sampling design, we select 5000 samples under one-stage cluster sampling of 100 households using the `cluster` function from the `sampling` package [@R-sampling], nad use the `svyarpr` function to estimate the ARPR in each of those samples:

```{r}
# compute size-like variable for PPS sampling design
eusilcP$aux <- log( ifelse( eusilcP$eqIncome >= 1000 , eusilcP$eqIncome , 1000 ) )

# define the number of monte carlo replicates
mc.rep <- 5000L

# simulation function
fun.sim1 <- function( this.iter ) {
  
  # select sample
  tt <- 
    sampling::cluster( data = eusilcP[ sample.int( nrow( eusilcP ) , nrow( eusilcP ) , replace = FALSE ) , ] , 
                      clustername = "hid" , 
                      size = 1000L , method = "systematic" , pik = eusilcP$aux )
  
  # collect data
  this.sample <- getdata( eusilcP , tt )
  
  # create survey design object
  this.desobj <- svydesign( ids = ~hid , probs = ~Prob , data = this.sample , nest = FALSE )
  
  # prepare for convey functions
  this.desobj <- convey_prep( this.desobj )
  
  # compute estimates
  svyarpr( ~eqIncome , this.desobj )
  
}

# set seed for reproducible results
set.seed( 1998 )

# run replications
estimate.list <- lapply( seq_len( mc.rep ) , function( zz ) fun.sim1( zz ) )
```

Then, we evaluate the Percentage Relative Bias (PRB) of the ARPR estimator. Under this scenario, the PRB of the ARPR estimator is -0.1450%.

```{r}
# estimate the expected value of the ARPR estimator
# using the average of the estimates
( theta.exp <- mean( sapply( estimate.list , coef ) ) )

# estimate the percentage relative bias
100 * ( theta.exp / theta.pop - 1)
```

For the variance estimator, we have:

```{r}
# estimate the variance of the ARPR estimator
# using the empirical variance of the estimates
( vartheta.popest <- var( sapply( estimate.list , coef ) ) )

# estimate the expected value of the ARPR variance estimator
# using the (estimated) expected value of the variance estimates
( vartheta.exp <- mean( sapply( estimate.list , vcov ) ) )

# estimate the percentage relative bias of the variance estimator
100 *  (vartheta.exp / vartheta.popest - 1 )
```

Under this scenario, the PRB of the ARPR variance estimator is -1.8873%.

Our simulations show that the Squared Bias of this estimator accounts for less than 0.1% of its Mean Squared Error:

```{r}
theta.bias2 <- ( theta.exp - theta.pop )^2
theta.mse <- theta.bias2 + vartheta.popest
100 * (theta.bias2 / theta.mse)
```

Next, we evaluate the Percentage Coverage Rate (PCR). In theory, under repeated sampling, the estimated 95% CIs should cover the population parameter approximately 95% of the time. We can evaluate that using:

```{r}
# estimate confidence intervals of the ARPR
# for each of the samples
est.coverage <-
  sapply(estimate.list, function(this.stat)
    confint(this.stat)[, 1] <= theta.pop &
      confint(this.stat)[, 2] >= theta.pop)

# evaluate empirical coverage
mean( est.coverage )
```
Our coverages are not too far from the nominal coverage level of 95%.

For additional usage examples of `svyarpr`, type `?convey::svyarpr` in the R console.

## Relative Median Income Ratio (svyrmir)

The relative median income ratio (RMIR) is the ratio of the median income of people aged above a value (65) to the median of people aged below the same value. In mathematical terms,

$$
rmir = \frac{median\{y_i; age_i >65 \}}{median\{y_i; age_i \leq 65 \}}.
$$

The details of the linearization of the RMIR and are discussed by @deville1999 and @osier2009.

## Relative Median Poverty Gap (svyrmpg)

The relative median poverty gap (RMPG) is the relative difference between the median income of people having income below the ARPT and the ARPT itself:

$$
rmpg = \frac{median\{y_i, y_i<arpt\}-arpt}{arpt}
$$

## Median Income Below the At Risk of Poverty Threshold  (svypoormed)

Median income below the at-risk-of-poverty-threshold (POORMED) is median of incomes of people having the income below the ARPT:

$$
poormed = median\{y_i; y_i< arpt\}
$$
The details of the linearization of the POORMED are discussed by @deville1999 and @osier2009.

```

The variance estimate is computed by using the approximation defined in \@ref(var), while the linearized variable $z$ is defined by \@ref(lin). The functions `convey::svypoormed` and `vardpoor::linpoormed` produce the same linearized variable $z$.

However, the measures of uncertainty do not line up, because `library(vardpoor)` defaults to an ultimate cluster method that can be replicated with an alternative setup of the `survey.design` object.

```{r}
# within each strata, sum up the weights
cluster_sums <-
  aggregate(eusilc$rb050 , list(eusilc$db040) , sum)

# name the within-strata sums of weights the `cluster_sum`
names(cluster_sums) <- c("db040" , "cluster_sum")

# merge this column back onto the data.frame
eusilc <- merge(eusilc , cluster_sums)

# construct a survey.design
# with the fpc using the cluster sum
des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster <-
  svydesign(
    ids = ~ rb030 ,
    strata = ~ db040 ,
    weights = ~ rb050 ,
    data = eusilc ,
    fpc = ~ cluster_sum
  )

# again, immediately run the convey_prep function on the `survey.design`
des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster <-
  convey_prep(des_eusilc_ultimate_cluster)

# matches

## Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class (svyfgt, svyfgtdec)

@foster1984 proposed a family of indicators to measure poverty.  This class of $FGT$ measures, can be defined as

\[
p=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k\in U}h(y_{k},\theta ), 
\]

where

\[
h(y_{k},\theta )=\left[ \frac{(\theta -y_{k})}{\theta }\right] ^{\gamma
}\delta \left\{ y_{k}\leq \theta \right\} , 
\]

where: $\theta$ is the poverty threshold; $\delta$ the indicator function that assigns value $1$ if the condition $\{y_{k}\leq \theta \}$ is satisfied and $0$ otherwise, and $\gamma$ is a non-negative constant.

If $\gamma =0$, the FGT(0) equals the poverty headcount ratio, which accounts for the spread of poverty. If $\gamma =1$, FGT(1) is the mean of the normalized income shortfall of the poor. By doing so, the measure takes into account both the spread and the intensity of poverty. When $\gamma =2$, the relative weight of larger shortfalls increases even more, which yields a measure that accounts for poverty severity, i.e., the inequality among the poor. This way, a transfer from a poor person to an even poorer person would reduce the FGT(2).

Although @foster1984 already presented a decomposition for the FGT(2) index, @aristondo2010 provided a general formula that decomposes the FGT($\gamma$) for any $\gamma \geqslant 2$. Put simply, any such FGT($\gamma$) index can be seen as function of the headcount ratio, the average normalized income gap among the poor, and a generalized entropy index of the normalized income gaps among poor. In mathematical terms,

\[
FGT_\gamma = FGT_0 \cdot I^\gamma \cdot \big[ 1 + \big( \gamma^2 -\gamma \big) GEI_\gamma^* \big] , \text{ } \gamma \geq 2
\]

where $I$ is the average normalized income gap among the poor and $GEI_\gamma^*$ is a generalized entropy index of such income gaps among the poor.

This result is particularly useful, as one can attribute cross-sectional differences of a FGT index to differences in the spread, depth, and inequality of poverty.

The FGT poverty class and its decomposition is implemented in the `convey` library by the function `svyfgt` and `svyfgtdec`, respectively.
The argument `thresh_type` of this function defines the type of poverty threshold adopted.
There are three possible choices:

1. `abs` -- fixed and given by the argument thresh_value.
2. `relq` -- a proportion of a quantile fixed by the argument `proportion` and the quantile is defined by the argument `order`.
3. `relm` -- a proportion of the mean fixed the argument `proportion`.

The quantile and the mean involved in the definition of the threshold are estimated for the whole population. When $\gamma=0$ and $\theta= .6*MED$, this measure is equal to the indicator ARPR computed by the function  `svyarpr`. The linearization of the FGT(0) is presented in @berger2003.

Next, we give some examples of the function `svyfgt` to estimate the values of the FGT poverty index.

Consider first the poverty threshold fixed ($\gamma=0$) in the value $10000$. The headcount ratio (FGT0) is

```{r comment=NA}
svyfgt(~ eqincome, des_eusilc, g = 0, abs_thresh = 10000)
```

The poverty gap ratio (FGT(1)) ($\gamma=1$) index for the poverty threshold fixed at the same value is

```{r comment=NA}
svyfgt(~ eqincome, des_eusilc, g = 1, abs_thresh = 10000)
```

To estimate the FGT(0) with the poverty threshold fixed at $0.6* MED$, we first fix the argument `type_thresh="relq"` and then use the default values for `percent` and `order`:

```{r comment=NA}
svyfgt(~ eqincome, des_eusilc, g = 0, type_thresh = "relq")
```
This matches the estimate obtained by:

```{r comment=NA}
svyarpr(~ eqincome, design = des_eusilc, .5, .6)
```
To estimate the poverty gap ratio with the poverty threshold equal to $0.6*MEAN$, we use:

```{r comment=NA}
svyfgt(~ eqincome, des_eusilc, g = 1, type_thresh = "relm")
```

**A replication example**

In July 2006, @jenkins2006 presented at the North American Stata Users' Group Meetings on the stata Atkinson Index command.  The example below reproduces those statistics.

In order to match the presentation's results using the `svyfgt` function from the `convey` library, the poverty threshold was considered absolute despite being directly estimated from the survey sample.  This effectively treats the variance of the estimated poverty threshold as zero; `svyfgt` does not account for the uncertainty of the poverty threshold when the level has been stated as absolute with the `abs_thresh=` parameter.  In general, we would instead recommend using either `relq` or `relm` in the `type_thresh=` parameter in order to account for the added uncertainty of the poverty threshold calculation.  This example serves only to show that `svyfgt` behaves properly as compared to other software.

## Watts poverty measure (svywatts, svywattsdec)

The measure proposed in @watts1968 satisfies a number of desirable poverty measurement axioms and is known to be one of the first distribution-sensitive poverty measures, as noted by @haughton2009. It is defined as:

\[
Watts = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in U} \log{ \bigg( \frac{y_i}{\theta} \bigg) \delta ( y_i \leqslant \theta) }.
\]

@murdoch1998 points out that the Watts poverty index can provide an estimate of the expected time to exit poverty. Given the expected growth rate of income per capita among the poor, $g$, the expected time taken to exit poverty $T_\theta$ would be:

\[
T_\theta = \frac{Watts}{g}.
\]

The Watts poverty index also has interesting decomposition properties. @blackburn1989 proposed a decomposition for the Watts poverty index, rewriting it in terms of the headcount ratio, the Watts poverty gap ratio and the mean log deviaton of poor incomes^[The mean log deviation (also known as Theil-L or Bourguignon-Theil index) is an inequality measure of the generalized entropy class. The family of generalized entropy indices is discussed in the next chapter.]. Mathematically,

\[
Watts = FGT_0 \big( I_w + L_* \big)
\]

where $I_w = \log(\theta/\mu_*)$ is the Watts poverty gap ratio^[ $\mu_*$ stands for the average income among the poor.] and $L_*$ is the mean log deviation of incomes among the poor. This can be estimated using the `svywattsdec` function.

This result can also be interpreted as a decomposition of the time taken to exit poverty, since

\[
\begin{aligned}
T_\theta &= \frac{Watts}{g} \\ 
&= \frac{FGT_0}{g} \big( I_w + L_* \big)
\end{aligned}
\]

As @murdoch1998 points out, if the income among the poor is equally distributed (i.e., $L_*=0$), the time taken to exit poverty is simply $FGT_0 I_w / g$. Therefore, $FGT_0 L_* / g$ can be seen as the additional time needed to exit poverty as a result of the inequality among the poor.
