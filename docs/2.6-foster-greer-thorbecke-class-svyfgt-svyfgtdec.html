<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class (svyfgt, svyfgtdec)</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (<label for="tufte-mn-39" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-39" class="margin-toggle">1984<span class="marginnote">Foster, James, Joel Greer, and Erik Thorbecke. 1984. <span>“A Class of Decomposable Poverty Measures.”</span> <em>Econometrica</em> 52 (3): 761–66. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913475">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913475</a>.</span>)</span> proposed a family of indicators to measure poverty. This class of <span class="math inline">\(FGT\)</span> measures, can be defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k\in U}h(y_{k},\theta ),
\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
h(y_{k},\theta )=\left[ \frac{(\theta -y_{k})}{\theta }\right] ^{\gamma
}\delta \left\{ y_{k}\leq \theta \right\} ,
\]</span></p>
<p>where: <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the poverty threshold; <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> the indicator function that assigns value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if the condition <span class="math inline">\(\{y_{k}\leq \theta \}\)</span> is satisfied and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a non-negative constant.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\gamma =0\)</span>, the FGT(0) equals the poverty headcount ratio, which accounts for the spread of poverty. If <span class="math inline">\(\gamma =1\)</span>, FGT(1) is the mean of the normalized income shortfall of the poor. By doing so, the measure takes into account both the spread and the intensity of poverty. When <span class="math inline">\(\gamma =2\)</span>, the relative weight of larger shortfalls increases even more, which yields a measure that accounts for poverty severity, i.e., the inequality among the poor. This way, a transfer from a poor person to an even poorer person would reduce the FGT(2).</p>
<p>Although <span class="citation">Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (<label for="tufte-mn-40" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-40" class="margin-toggle">1984<span class="marginnote">Foster, James, Joel Greer, and Erik Thorbecke. 1984. <span>“A Class of Decomposable Poverty Measures.”</span> <em>Econometrica</em> 52 (3): 761–66. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913475">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1913475</a>.</span>)</span> already presented a decomposition for the FGT(2) index, <span class="citation">Aristondo, De La Vega, and Urrutia (<label for="tufte-mn-41" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-41" class="margin-toggle">2010<span class="marginnote">Aristondo, Oihana, Casilda Lasso De La Vega, and Ana Urrutia. 2010. <span>“A New Multiplicative Decomposition for the Foster–Greer–Thorbecke Poverty Indices.”</span> <em>Bulletin of Economic Research</em> 62 (3): 259–67. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8586.2009.00320.x">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8586.2009.00320.x</a>.</span>)</span> provided a general formula that decomposes the FGT(<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) for any <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \geqslant 2\)</span>. Put simply, any such FGT(<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) index can be seen as function of the headcount ratio, the average normalized income gap among the poor, and a generalized entropy index of the normalized income gaps among poor. In mathematical terms,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
FGT_\gamma = FGT_0 \cdot I^\gamma \cdot \big[ 1 + \big( \gamma^2 -\gamma \big) GEI_\gamma^* \big] , \text{ } \gamma \geq 2
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the average normalized income gap among the poor and <span class="math inline">\(GEI_\gamma^*\)</span> is a generalized entropy index of such income gaps among the poor.</p>
<p>This result is particularly useful, as one can attribute cross-sectional differences of a FGT index to differences in the spread, depth, and inequality of poverty.</p>
<p>The FGT poverty class and its decomposition is implemented in the <code>convey</code> library by the function <code>svyfgt</code> and <code>svyfgtdec</code>, respectively.
The argument <code>thresh_type</code> of this function defines the type of poverty threshold adopted.
There are three possible choices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>abs</code> – fixed and given by the argument thresh_value.</li>
<li><code>relq</code> – a proportion of a quantile fixed by the argument <code>proportion</code> and the quantile is defined by the argument <code>order</code>.</li>
<li><code>relm</code> – a proportion of the mean fixed the argument <code>proportion</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The quantile and the mean involved in the definition of the threshold are estimated for the whole population. When <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta= .6*MED\)</span>, this measure is equal to the indicator ARPR computed by the function <code>svyarpr</code>. The linearization of the FGT(0) is presented in <span class="citation">Berger and Skinner (<label for="tufte-mn-42" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-42" class="margin-toggle">2003<span class="marginnote">Berger, Yves G., and Chris J.

<p>Next, we give some examples of the function <code>svyfgt</code> to estimate the values of the FGT poverty index.</p>
<p>Consider first the poverty threshold fixed (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0\)</span>) in the value <span class="math inline">\(10000\)</span>. The headcount ratio (FGT0) is</p>

The example below reproduces those statistics.</p>
<p>In order to match the presentation’s results using the <code>svyfgt</code> function from the <code>convey</code> library, the poverty threshold was considered absolute despite being directly estimated from the survey sample. This effectively treats the variance of the estimated poverty threshold as zero; <code>svyfgt</code> does not account for the uncertainty of the poverty threshold when the level has been stated as absolute with the <code>abs_thresh=</code> parameter. In general, we would instead recommend using either <code>relq</code> or <code>relm</code> in the <code>type_thresh=</code> parameter in order to account for the added uncertainty of the poverty threshold calculation. This example serves only to show that <code>svyfgt</code> behaves properly as compared to other software.</p>
