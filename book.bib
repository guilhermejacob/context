Moreover, it presents a new measure which generalises Bourguignon (1999) and includes Tsui measures (1999), while preserving the advantages of Maasoumi's method (1986) of explicitly acknowledging the role of parameters relevant to multivariate settings. Finally, an application to Argentine data is provided in order to illustrate the decisions involved in the process of applying these measures and the usefulness of having appropriate criteria when making those decisions. }

  abstract={This paper proposes a new methodology for multidimensional poverty measurement consisting of an identification method [rho]k that extends the traditional intersection and union approaches, and a class of poverty measures M[alpha]. Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by 'counting' the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.},

	abstract = {MPI estimates the Adjusted Multidimensional Headcount Ratio developed by Alkire and Foster (2011), also known as the Multidimensional Poverty Index. With ordinal and real-valued indicators MPI allows estimating the entire parametric class of Alkire-Foster poverty measures for arbitrary values of the poverty-aversion parameter. All poverty measures can be conveniently decomposed by deprivation indicators and population sub-groups. Users can specify an indefinite number of indicators and use a flexible weighting structure for each of them. Poverty thresholds can be set directly within the command line using a flexible notation for identifying who is above or below the threshold. Deprivation indicators can be grouped into broader policy domains which simplifies the analysis of results in many empirical applications. The survey design is fully taken into account when computing indicators, standard errors and covariances. MPI allows using standard Stata features such as nonparametric bootstrap estimation of the results and mean-comparison tests.},

The general functional form of decomposable indices is derived without assuming that the measures are differentiable. The analysis is suitable for extension to the many other kinds of indices for which a similar relationship between the overall index value and subaggregates is desirable.},

First, a concise treatment of classical univariate results is given, including majorization with different means and different population sizes, as well as Lorenz orderings of relative and absolute disparity. Second, alternatives to the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers are discussed which are based on transfers about a given threshold. Third, disparity in several attributes and multivariate majorization are investigated, and a multivariate version of the Lorenz curved is introduced."

The idea that poverty is morally unacceptable and can be eradicated through redistribution of wealth provides the grounds for the methodology. The line is defined as the value that delimitates the aggregated income required to eradicate poverty by the way of transfers from the rich to the poor. I estimate an affluence line using Brazilian 1999 National Household Survey data and briefly discuss the results.},

    abstract = { Richness indices are distributional statistics used to measure the incomes, earnings or wealth of the rich. This article uses a linearization method to derive the sampling variances for recently introduced distributionally sensitive richness measures when estimated from survey data. The results are derived for two cases: (1) when the richness line is known and (2) when it has to be estimated from the sample. The proposed approach enables easy consideration of the effects of a complex sampling design. Monte Carlo results suggest that the proposed approach allows for reliable inference in case of ‚Äòconcave‚Äô richness indices, but that it is not satisfactory in case of ‚Äòconvex‚Äô richness measures. The standard bootstrap methods give similar results for ‚Äòconcave‚Äô measures, but they are also unreliable for ‚Äòconvex‚Äô indices. The performance of the bootstrap inference can be improved in some cases using a semi-parametric approach. The variance formulae are illustrated with a comparison of wealth richness in Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. }

abstract = {In this paper, we define a new class of richness measures. In contrast to the often used headcount, these new measures are sensitive to changes in rich individuals' incomes and, therefore, allow for a more sophisticated analysis of richness. We demonstrate the application of these new measures in analyzing the development of poverty and richness over time in Germany. Moreover, we compare Germany to many other European countries and investigate the impact of tax reforms on poverty and richness. Using these examples, we show the importance of taking the intensity of changes into account and not only the number of people beyond a given richness line (headcount). We propose to use the new measures in addition to the headcount index for a more comprehensive analysis of richness.},
