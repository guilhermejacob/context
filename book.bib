  abstract={This paper proposes a new methodology for multidimensional poverty measurement consisting of an identification method [rho]k that extends the traditional intersection and union approaches, and a class of poverty measures M[alpha]. Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by 'counting' the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.},

With ordinal and real-valued indicators MPI allows estimating the entire parametric class of Alkire-Foster poverty measures for arbitrary values of the poverty-aversion parameter. All poverty measures can be conveniently decomposed by deprivation indicators and population sub-groups. Users can specify an indefinite number of indicators and use a flexible weighting structure for each of them. Poverty thresholds can be set directly within the command line using a flexible notation for identifying who is above or below the threshold. Deprivation indicators can be grouped into broader policy domains which simplifies the analysis of results in many empirical applications. The survey design is fully taken into account when computing indicators, standard errors and covariances. MPI allows using standard Stata features such as nonparametric bootstrap estimation of the results and mean-comparison tests.},

The general functional form of decomposable indices is derived without assuming that the measures are differentiable. The analysis is suitable for extension to the many other kinds of indices for which a similar relationship between the overall index value and subaggregates is desirable.},
